# MIMO-Communication-Experiment
Channel  capacity, fading channel, QAM modulation, MIMO detection, space-time coding and  MATLAB simulation of MIMO system.

Task 1: Monte Carlo simulation to roughly measure the MIMO capacity.

Task 2: 2-by-2 MIMO system with QPSK modulation with grey-mapping. ML, ZF, MMSE results.

Task 3: Alamouti code with QPSK modulation and Gray mapping
